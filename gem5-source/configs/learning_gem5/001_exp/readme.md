Goal: To measure the overhead of Address-Scaling technique

Experiment: Reduce the L1, L2, L3 cache capacities based on the scaling factor

For example: For a scaling factor of (7,1), reduce the cacheblock size by 1 byte and 
             analyze the performance. Repeat this for a variety of scaling factors.
